Hi, I see you are looking for a developer to convert your designs to pixel-perfect and mobile responsive web pages. I am interested in the job. I have consistently delivered desired results for my clients with almost 100% success rates by testing and revising my work according to their feedback.

Work Sample (video demo) - https://www.dropbox.com/s/8flxepay4a2aray/work-sample-demo.mp4?dl=0

I worked on a similar project where a client asked to convert their website's home-page design to a responsive page layout. I used the Bootstrap framework to develop pages rapidly with custom HTML, CSS, SCSS, JS, and jQuery and added meaningful animations on page load.
Home-page - https://projects.webdevpuneet.com/archives/employify/index.html

The client was happy with the result and gave 5-star rating feedback on Upwork and asked me to develop the rest of the pages.
